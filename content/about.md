Hello, this is data-falopa. The name comes from: data=data and falopa=trashy/drug. This site is usually about giving (trashy) insights into (trashy) data. Nevertheless, it's sometimes about random facts coming from totally meaningful data.

If you don't like something about this site, it's probably [Violeta](https://twitter.com/violetrzn)'s fault. It could also be due to the fact that she has no money to spend on this project, she is from Latin America. Thus, she's not going to pay for ~~anything fancy~~ anything. Although, she's not asking for money, it's already a kind of adopted philosophy: "Do not pay for anything that you don't need". 

In the future, we plan to include [recommendations](/recommendations) of data visualizations about serious topics.   

Finally, this site is built with Hugo through the blogdown R package. We used the Sam theme by [Victoria Drake](https://victoria.dev) and  [contributors](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam/graphs/contributors). Thank you!
